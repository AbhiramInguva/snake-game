**Snake Game with High Score**

This repository contains a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module. The game allows players to control a snake using arrow keys and navigate it to consume food, growing in length. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game or the snake's own body.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3
- Turtle module (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

**How to Run the Game:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/AbhiramInguva/snake-game.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd snake-game`
3. Run the game using the following command: `python main.py`

**Game Controls:**
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.

**Scoring:**
- The score is calculated based on the number of food items the snake consumes.
- Each time the snake eats food, the score increases by one.
- The high score is updated and displayed at the end of each game.

**Game Over:**
The game ends when:
- The snake collides with the boundaries of the game window.
- The snake collides with its own body.

**Features:**
- Responsive keyboard input using the Turtle module.
- Snake grows in length each time it consumes food.
- Randomized placement of food items for dynamic gameplay.
- High score tracking and display.
